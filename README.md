//Liminal- In Between Decision and Departure



_Liminal

Clarity before the leap.

Liminal is a transparent, system-driven platform that guides students through the study-abroad application process with verification, automation, and human oversight — while keeping final control in the student’s hands.

It is designed to replace opaque consultancy workflows with a clear, auditable process that reduces mistakes, fear, and dependency.

Why Liminal Exists

Applying to universities abroad is not hard because it is complex —
it is hard because mistakes are expensive.

Students rely on consultants not for intelligence, but for safety:

fear of missing documents

fear of eligibility mismatches

fear of visa rejection due to clerical errors

fear of opaque fees and hidden incentives

Liminal exists to turn this fear into a verifiable process.

What Liminal Does

Liminal acts as a guided application system, not an agent.

The platform:

evaluates eligibility before applications are submitted

verifies documents against country-specific standards

reviews and scores Statements of Purpose (SOPs)

automates repetitive application tasks

provides optional human review when certainty matters

The student always submits the final application themselves.

Core Principles

Transparency over persuasion
Every step is visible. No hidden decisions.

Student control by design
Automation assists — it does not replace consent.

Verification before submission
Errors are caught early, not after rejection.

Human support where it matters
Experts review, systems execute.

Key Features (MVP)
1. Smart Profile & Eligibility Engine

Students input academic background, test scores, budget, and preferences.
Liminal generates a verified eligibility match for selected countries and universities.

2. Document Vault & Compliance Checker

A secure dashboard to upload:

Passport

Academic transcripts

CV

SOP

Proof of funds

Documents are checked against official immigration and university requirements (e.g. missing seals, formatting issues, validity).

3. SOP Review & Scoring

Instead of writing essays for students, Liminal:

evaluates structure, clarity, and relevance

checks alignment with country-specific expectations

provides actionable improvement suggestions

The student remains the author.

4. Guided Application Automation

For repetitive portal workflows, Liminal assists with:

form pre-fill

field validation

step-by-step guidance

Final submission is always performed by the student.

5. Human-in-the-Loop Support

Students can book limited sessions with verified mentors who are:

currently studying or working in the destination country

available to clarify doubts, not sell outcomes

Trust & Safety

No guaranteed admissions

No hidden commissions influencing recommendations

Clear refund policy:
If Liminal makes a clerical or system error, 90% of the fee is refunded

Trust is treated as infrastructure, not marketing.

Current Scope

Initial focus: single-country deployment (e.g. Denmark)

Limited university set during beta

Invite-only pilot users

The system is designed to expand country-by-country, not all at once.

Who This Is For?

Students applying abroad without wanting agents

Parents seeking transparency and accountability

Institutions interested in cleaner applicant pipelines

This is not for users looking for shortcuts or guarantees.

Project Status

Prototype / Early MVP

Currently under active development.
Features and workflows are evolving based on real user feedback.

Vision

Liminal aims to become the application infrastructure behind global education —
where guidance is calm, systems are visible, and trust is earned through correctness.
